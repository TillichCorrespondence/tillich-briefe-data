            <p>Having intend<del rend="ow">ing</del>ed to write to you last evening, i will do that
               just now. I have a lovely view into the garden, which looks now very pretty. But the
               violets are all dead now… First of all many thanks for your letter, I was so glad to
               get it, and to hear that you like staying in <rs ref="#tillich_place_id__37"
                  type="place">Berlin</rs> so much. <pb n="2"/> There are many people and things,
               that miss you very much here in <rs ref="#tillich_place_id__549" type="place"
                  >Nauen</rs>. At first „<rs type="person" ref="#tillich_person_id__3169"
               >Foeke</rs>“ and „<rs type="person" ref="#tillich_person_id__3168">Roland</rs>“.
               Having the absence of Superintendents. <rs type="person"
                  ref="#tillich_person_id__3168">Roland</rs> was lying all day long in the sun in
               the yard. I am quite sure he felt very lonely. – Then <rs
                  ref="#tillich_person_id__2128" type="person">Fräulein Zschorsch</rs> and I. The
               other day we had a nice drive in the carriage via Forsthaus – <rs
                  ref="#tillich_place_id__600" type="place">Bredow</rs> –, and we <pb n="3"/> were
               talking of you. <rs ref="#tillich_person_id__2128" type="person">Fräulein
                  Zschorsch</rs> too is now very unhappy, she told me that there were many questions
               she would like to ask you. She intended to come to me and to write, but I know <del
                  rend="s">that</del> she does not dare. Is she not a little silly? Perhaps she
               could meet you once in <rs ref="#tillich_place_id__37" type="place">Berlin</rs>? I
               wish to have the two sermons; you would give <pb n="4"/> them to her, would&apos;nt you?
               It is a pity to say, but I can´t come in some time! My aunt feels much better now,
                  <sic>to-day</sic> she will go for the first time into the garden, but you see,
                  <sic>to-morrow</sic> is the birthday of <rs type="person"
                  ref="#tillich_person_id__3170">Onkel Troll</rs> and we shall go to dinner there at
               3 o´clock. On Friday I shall probably go to <rs ref="#tillich_place_id__602"
                  type="place">Havelberg</rs>, it is the birthday of my <rs type="person"
                  ref="#tillich_person_id__3172">sister</rs>. Now <rs type="person"
                  ref="#tillich_person_id__3173">Tante Berta</rs> thinks it is <pb n="5"/> too much
               pleasure for me! – Last Sunday I had the first „Children´s Service“. I have 9 girls
               to teach, and I think it is very nice. The other day I called at <rs type="person"
                  ref="#tillich_person_id__3171">Schwester Meta</rs> and asked her to come to my <rs
                  type="person" ref="#tillich_person_id__3173">aunt</rs> in order to get me for the
               „Old-women – meeting“. She promised to do so, and probably she is coming this
               afternoon. I am a <pb n="6"/> little anxious about it. Besides she gave me 3 adresses
               of old people to go to read something to them. I shall go next week to them. But when
               my aunt does not like me to go? Am I not very weak? Anyhow I shall do so what you
               have told me, and I hope to feel a little more satisfied. – Is that not a very long
                  <pb n="7"/> letter? I must finish now. Let me soon have some few lines again! </p>
